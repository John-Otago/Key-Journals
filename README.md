# Key Journals in HASS

A J.W. Project  
Last Update: 14 July 2021 (for July 2021 – June 2022)  

This is a collection of the most high-impact journals in HASS (Humanities & Social Sciences).

Each year, I process the data from the latest Journal Citation Reports (JCR) to select and compile a list of journals with the highest impact in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI).

I publish my criteria here, but the list is *not* for public release as it is based on proprietary data. My students and colleagues can contact me for a copy (not to be shared publicly).

This project includes:
- Key SSCI Journals (selected each year based on the criteria below)\*
- Ranking of AHCI/SSCI double-indexed journals (by Impact Factors and by Categories)\*
- Journal Ranking by SSCI quartiles (not category quartile)\**
- Full List of SSCI Journals (with Impact Factors, SSCI quartile, and category quartile)\**
- SSCI Journal Ranking by Impact Factors\***
- SSCI Journal Ranking by Categories\***
- Raw Data (SCIE, SSCI, AHCI, ESCI)\***

\*The first two lists are my own selection and compilation after processing the raw data from the JCR.

\**The next two lists required additional data processing to compile, although the info is available in some form in different parts of the JCR system (e.g. under individual journal profiles).

\***The last three should be directly accessible if your institution has subscribed to the JCR. If your institution only has a subscription to the Web of Science but not the JCR, you’ll need to check each journal individually.

Note: 

*Starting 2021, journals in the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) and the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) are included in the JCR but still don’t have Impact Factors.*

*They do have a new metric called Journal Impact Indicators (JCI), as all the other journals since 2021, which may help to evaluate the impact of AHCI and ESCI journals.*

*Some AHCI journals are also indexed in SSCI and hence have Impact Factors—that’s why I always compile a list of AHCI/SSCI double-indexed journals with all the metrics available.*

**Disclaimer:**

This project is mainly based on the Journal Impact Factors (JIF) while considering the newly added Journal Impact Indicators (JCI). Both metrics *only measure the impact of research by citation*. The project is hence limited at multiple levels: 

1. The JIF and the JCI won’t capture the full picture and the full life-cycle of citations.
2. Only journals are captured, while other forms of research outputs are precluded.
3. Some indexes (AHCI and ESCI) don’t have Impact Factors and some disciplines barely use IFs.
4. Research impact should be measured by multiple metrics, not only by citations.
5. Above all, not all research impact is measurable and quantifiable.

**Nonetheless, journal indexing and ranking are still important:**

1. They help students and early-career researchers avoid predatory journals and publishers.
2. They help students and scholars choose suitable outlets for their work.
3. Though not perfect or complete, citation metrics are central to many academic activities, especially when it comes to evaluation and quality assurance across individual, institutional, and national and international levels.
4. At the end of the day, we need something measurable as part of the quality criteria for anything from tenure review and promotion to global university rankings.
5. Last, if you have a good article, why not publish it in a higher-ranked journal with a larger readership and more visibility, impact, and reputation?

*The last thing is the debate of the JCR (Journal Citation Reports) vs. the SJR (SCImago Journal Rank). There are several reasons that I choose the former over the latter—that’s another topic for another day.*

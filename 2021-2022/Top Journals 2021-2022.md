**Minimum Impact Factor (2-year) in the Top Journals (HASS) list:

**[Optional] Minimum Journal Impact Indicator: 1.00 (= average) in at least one of the past two years**

The new metric JCI (Journal Impact Indicators) is based on the Category Normalized Citation Impact (CNCI). This offers ‘a single value that is easy to interpret and compare’ across all the fields to measure citations: 1.0 = average, 2.0 = twice the average, 3.0 = three times the average, etc.

JCIs can be checked using WoS Master Journal List:

This metric is currently optional in my Top Journals list, as it is newly released and needs to 'stand the test of time', so to speak. But if a journal is well below 1.00 in the past two years, you may want to choose another journal.

Again, I publish my criteria here, but the list is not for public release as it is based on proprietary data. My students and colleagues can contact me for a copy (not to be shared publicly).
